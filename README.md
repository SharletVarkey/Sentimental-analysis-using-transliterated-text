### Sentiment Analysis of Transliterated Data

#### Overview
I have developed multiple machine learning models to perform sentiment analysis on a transliterated dataset, classifying text data into two classes: positive and negative sentiments. The models implemented include:

1. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
2. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**
3. **Logistic Regression**
4. **Random Forest**
5. **Naive Bayes**

#### Dataset
- **Type**: Transliterated text data
- **Classes**: Two (positive, negative)
- **Modification**: The dataset has been customized for the analysis, involving preprocessing steps specific to transliterated text (e.g., handling non-standard spellings, tokenization).

#### Common Steps for Model Development
1. **Import necessary libraries**: Import required libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, and appropriate modules from `sklearn` for preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

2. **Load dataset**: Load the transliterated dataset containing text comments and their corresponding sentiment labels.

3. **Preprocessing**: Perform necessary preprocessing steps on the text data, such as tokenization, removing stop words, and converting text to numerical representation using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.

4. **Split dataset**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

5. **Model creation**: Instantiate the chosen machine learning model(s) (e.g., SVM, LSTM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes).

6. **Training**: Train the model(s) on the training dataset using the fit method.

7. **Prediction**: Use the trained model(s) to make predictions on the test dataset.

8. **Evaluation**: Calculate the accuracy of the model(s) by comparing predicted labels with actual labels from the test dataset.

#### Key Findings
- **Performance Comparison**: Compare the accuracy of different models to identify the most effective approach for sentiment analysis on transliterated text data.
- **Data Suitability**: Assess the suitability of the transliterated dataset for sentiment analysis and identify any specific challenges or limitations encountered during model development.
- **Model Strengths**: Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each model in handling transliterated text data and its implications for real-world applications.

#### Conclusion
My work demonstrates a comprehensive approach to sentiment analysis using various machine learning techniques applied to transliterated text data. By comparing the performance of different models, valuable insights can be gained into the most effective methods for sentiment analysis in this context.
